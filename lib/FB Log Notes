formattedDate = the variable used to set the created firebase document to the current day
selectedDate = the date the user wants to get to/view

document.id is now a unique id generated by firestore for added foods.
The log page now just uses the food name from the fields within the unique document.
(allows for duplicate foods to be added)

The fields 'name' and 'serving_size' are purely for display/visual usage (Strings)
Meanwhile the 'servings' field is meant to denote the amount of servings the user has eaten.
    This is mainly used to calculate the total nutrients for the individual entries, but also used for display.
    The servings variable should only need to be used for the "adding food" page, and can also be ignored.
